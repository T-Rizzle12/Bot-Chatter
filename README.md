# Important
I have not forgotten about this addon, I have been focusing on fixing bugs in my other addon Bot AI Improvements. Now that Bot AI Improvements is in a stable and mostly bug free state. I will resume the Major Update I have planned for this addon.

# Major Update
Beta - You can now customise the kill lines. Just go to Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\ems\botchatter\cfg
If you can't find the botchatter directory it should be automatically created after loading into a map. :)

# Current list of events that make the bots chat:
- OnGameEvent_heal_begin
- OnGameEvent_revive_begin
- OnGameEvent_player_incapacitated
- OnGameEvent_player_ledge_grab
- OnGameEvent_charger_pummel_start
- OnGameEvent_tongue_grab
- OnGameEvent_jockey_ride
- OnGameEvent_lunge_pounce
- OnGameEvent_player_entered_checkpoint
- OnGameEvent_player_left_checkpoint
- OnGameEvent_revive_success
- OnGameEvent_player_death

# Todo:
- [ ] Have bots create random conversations
- [Partially Added] Allow people to have custom messages
- [x] ~~Add bot friendly fire lines~~
